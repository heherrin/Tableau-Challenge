The purpose of this writeup is to detail some of my findings on the CitiBike analysis.

One key finding of our research is that riders spend significantly more time on their bikes based on ride duration on the weekends as opposed to on weekdays.
This suggests that riders on weekdays may be using CitiBike for shorter trips such as commutes, as opposed to more leisurely rides on the weekends.

Our analysis also noted that a significant portion, over 90%, of users on which the riders gender is unknown were customers.  
This indicates that CitiBike may have a hard time gaining demographic information on its riders if the rider is not subscribed to the service.

In building the requested map for city officials, we noted that a majority of the most popular stations for starting their ride were located in lower Manhattan & around Central Park.
However, there were some additional stations with high popularity outside of those areas, particularly around other parks.

We also ntoed that while the most popular stations were very centralized to the Lower Manhattan & Central Park areas, the stations with the longest duration times were much more spread out, though still in Manhattan.
This indicated to us that riders in Upper Manhattan tend to take longer rides, or maybe have longer commutes.
